# My Advent of Code Journey ðŸŽ„

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my GitHub repository documenting my exciting adventure in the Advent of Code event. It's my first time participating, and I'm eager to share my code, progress, and experiences with the coding challenges. Also I'll (hopefully) be updating this repository every day in the month of december every year to keep up with the AoC challenge and keep my code up to date.

Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸŽ…

## Directory Structure

To keep things organized, I've structured the repository into dedicated directories for each day's challenge. Here's a brief overview:

- [**`/2023/Day1/`**](https://github.com/ZachLTech/AoC/tree/main/2023/Day1): Code for Day 1 challenge.
- [**`/2023/Day2/`**](https://github.com/ZachLTech/AoC/tree/main/2023/Day2): Code for Day 2 challenge.
- [**`/2023/Day3/`**](https://github.com/ZachLTech/AoC/tree/main/2023/Day3): Code for Day 3 challenge.
- [**`/2023/Day4/`**](https://github.com/ZachLTech/AoC/tree/main/2023/Day4): Code for Day 4 challenge. - A little late since I slept for once...
- [**`/2023/Day5/`**](https://github.com/ZachLTech/AoC/tree/main/2023/Day5): Code for Day 5 challenge. - Will be a little late since I was catching up...
- *come back tomorrow for more...*

- Ok so I kinda had finals at university and never continued AoC for this year sadly ðŸ’€ afterwards, most of my freetime went to AoH instead (Advent of Homelab aka me just working on a new homelab setup lol)
